"subject: zero path termination in path manager matt / ben : i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times . based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination . 1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month . this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume is on that path in the future month . 2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl ( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the scheduler when you are ready . 3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to paths for oba tracking . all : please respond via e - mail with any comments . richard x 37339",ham

"subject: new storage flag we are going to add a new drop down flag to storage in sitara to differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each are treated differently for inventory accounting purposes . a change will also be made to global contracts and unify , and is intended to assist with oa variances on storage . on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal type which will be a required field . someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be a required field - physical facility or synthetic . ( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be converted - as well as results for global conversion ) global contracts uses the flags from sitara to set up new contracts - so sitara will add the flag on the deal . the flag will be stored in global contracts - which will feed the flag to unify . once the existing deals are converted in sitara , global contracts can add the appropriate flag to their system . once this is complete and unify is ready , unify can begin to feed in the information from global contracts , and we will then be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system . in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs . physical storage deals . let me know if you have any questions .",ham

"subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . "" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . "" given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted .",ham

"subject: did you notice ? never agaln minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . government spokesman raanan gissin said four soldiers were killed . six people were taken to hospital - - four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military sources said . the sources said another soldier remained beneath the rubble . gissin said rescue operations were continuing sunday night . the attack "" indicates that unless there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .",spam

"subject: message subject think getting a 1 . 95 % rate is impossible ? think again ! we can offer you the absolute rock - bottom lowest rate , guaranteed . we work with all credit types . visit our site now , for your rate quote . click here now ! now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review of the two systems . i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit , both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest . the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) . after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored comedy ) , and a few more "" experimental "" music channels which most will find totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular ( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion . the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) . this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my cancelling xm . xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan . xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) . however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .",spam

"subject: re : big cowboy / gepl actuals for february please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue . donna & george , please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner . thank you for your time . please let me know if you have any questions , comments , suggestions . mary 35251",ham

( this has been the stated process for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process as well . ) please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team , yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team , or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment . thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a meaningful one . it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0",ham

"subject: fw : section 311 just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : hull , bryan sent : tuesday , august 14 , 2001 7 : 16 am to : redmond , brian subject : fw : section 311 brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . . commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere . here are the facts in this case . 1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services . 2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . ) 3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request . 4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 . 5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days . 6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request . 7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e . 8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp . 9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs . 10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments . 11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service . the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 . please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .",ham

if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes ? why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios . you talk about german technocracy , and you get automobiles . you talk about american technocracy , and you find men on the moon - not once , but several times - and safely home again . you talk about scandals , and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here . when the railways of france , germany and india were breaking down through age , it was the americans who rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an old caboose . both are still broke . i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble . can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake . our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around . they will come out of this thing with their flag high . and when they do , they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada is not one of those . "" stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! ! this is one of the best editorials that i have ever read regarding the united states . it is nice that one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it . we are always blamed for everything , and never even get a thank you for the things we do . i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am just a single american that has read this , tribute to the united states = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ? easy unsubscribe click here : http : / / topica . com / u / ? a 84 vnf . a 9 ivhm ? or send an email to : brcc . yf - unsubscribe topica . com ? this email was sent to : dfarmer enron . com ? ? t o p i c a - - register now to manage your mail ! ? http : / / www . topica . com / partner / tago 2 / register ? = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =",ham

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from : thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 44 am to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect ect , dianne seib / cal / ect ect cc : sylvia a campos / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , faye ellis / hou / ect ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect ect , scott mills / hou / ect ect , russ severson / hou / ect ect , martha stevens / hou / ect ect , karie hastings / hou / ect ect , regina perkins / hou / ect ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect ect , steven gullion / hou / ect ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect ect , donna greif / hou / ect ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : "" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . "" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . "" warning - not the same legal entity "" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect ect , thomas engel / hou / ect ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , faye ellis / hou / ect ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , scott mills / hou / ect ect , richard elwood / hou / ect ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect , gayle horn / corp / enron enron , brant reves / hou / ect ect , russell diamond / hou / ect ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect ect , steve jackson / hou / ect ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .",ham

"subject: new enrononline functionality in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below . stack manager changes top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out . restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as restricted top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "" restricted top of stack "" feature . advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" all "" option from the drop down box . website changes new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows . the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box . price of limit orders modify limit orders customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the "" today ' s orders "" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the "" set "" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order . expiration time for limit orders customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours . float the today ' s orders section you can now float the "" limit order "" section . in order to do so , right click in the "" today ' s orders "" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window "" stay on top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option . mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount . in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group . changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users . please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords . if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 -

"subject: god bless you dr . nkem george . bank of the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria . my dear friend , i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria . i have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality . on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred united states dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine notification in accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , we found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a security company in europe for safekeeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it and according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and half years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6 million u . s dollars that is presently in a security company in europe . i contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the money in the security company in europe . we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum would be for you if you agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay back the expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has been claimed and lodged in your account . in the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction , the following information would be needed from you to expedite action . 1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund . this would ensure that the security company in europe releases the consignment / fund to you . 2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where you can be reached at all time because this transaction entails constant communication . the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested , send the requested information via email i await your response urgently . regards , dr . nkem george . .",spam

"subject: new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products . this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . summary of new features multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child ( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed against a single parent . static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout . sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key . parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) . detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) . large vertical chains should be avoided . related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link . static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons . one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate . you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . sorting / selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in alphabetical order ) . if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another . parent products and f / x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product . some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent , rather than managed individually . assistance as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 ) 20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) . general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .",ham

( source : company website ) currently trading at . 012 p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week . pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock : p ( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5 weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in price because they are promoted , making a very large number of investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxpp about the company : p delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america . p the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward . p among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa , south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified . p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration . p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls , they also control a gold property with great potential . the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program . pp ( source : company website ) p recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in preparation of work program . p delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america . p delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond exploration in south america . pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend and next week ?

"subject: market watch undervalued report f april 2004 top pick of the month life energy and technology holdings , inc . ( otcbb : leth ) leth receives $ 250 , 000 , 000 in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste - to - energy units in the united states . first unit to roll - out in new orleans in early second quarter . we are expecting earth - shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over $ 100 million in sales orders in the past year , and tops that record - setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $ 8 . 62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion . * * our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick * * ushg featured at . 75 reached 3 . 65 in 8 days ! traded as high as 7 . 00 since ! the biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste . leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures . financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales : the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this $ 1 . 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to $ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor in that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding ! leth stock guidance : current price : 1 . 80 near - term target : 4 . 80 projected high for ' 04 : 12 . 50 leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system : leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc .

"subject: northern natural gas yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses . the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts . we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services . ken dear ets colleague : on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy . in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved . the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business . beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas . over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work ! stan",ham

( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get this assigned ? i can find old notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let me know . lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . channel industries pipeline - several issues here : 1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately . someone needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero , that were nominated for january . 2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated . 3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203 10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return . pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned issues . hank eisenhours duties were split : mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts , december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues . carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly . hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify . hpl operational seems to be left unassigned . i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .",ham

into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron . the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n . america . we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity . it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding hpl to tim determing . regards , brian",ham

"subject: tenaska iv agency fee can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 . my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further . thanks , megan 713 - 571 - 3261",ham

"subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 ) fred or anita , i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121 is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done , she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter . for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957 and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use 449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal 449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal 449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences . in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on that yet . please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !",ham

"subject: some after thoughts to our meeting hi daren , i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning . you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share . you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team . this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem ? there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual team members ? i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing ! mike teamleadership center mobile : 713 - 598 - 6732 office : 713 - 871 - 8326 fax : 713 - 871 - 1707 home : 409 - 321 - 0680 mam teamlead . com",ham

"" is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it . please learn . 7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 "" , weight 185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base . this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid . 8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder , they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability . the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ? 9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now . 10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly . 11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending "" dukes of hazard "" episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool . as my friend stephen johnson once said : "" if the world were ever to get an enema , college station is where you would connect the hose .

it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .",ham
