( ndin ) commented today on the recent announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol ( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service . in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to stifle competition . the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers , cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad international inc . the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market . the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher . nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration , but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product . about nomad international inc . nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl , cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace , 2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their relatives in their country of origin . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade monday ! go ndin . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 30 oo dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been wrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in the sub ject to ournewsletter 24 yahoo . com",spam

"subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction . deal terms - - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing . - - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas . - - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares . - - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year . enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary . management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo . i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron . management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined . the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible . as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses . i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 . i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse . and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron . investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ;

"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country . due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer is a violation of federal case law . as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no problem . i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth , and call it ecology . i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and ignorant and call it enlightenment . however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is violated . this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical . apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and his commandments . nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression . for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor , praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event , please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law - yet . "" and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one nation under god . somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion . praise god that his remnant remains ! let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001 jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my father .

"subject: california energy crisis california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron  , s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities . increasing supply california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .",ham

"subject: tenaska iv gas daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled ) : 1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 ) and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary - 230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at 2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 . 2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged $ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91 price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at 2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 . i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for 2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at . 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu . in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 . looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of $ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) . so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of $ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity . month plant gas price amount november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843 november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 ) october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 ) nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000 sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52 total $ 484 , 234 . 03 i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks . james",ham

"subject: california energy crisis california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron ' s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a "" turnback "" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts : ? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates . ? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices . ? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times . enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities . increasing supply california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .",ham

"subject: marketing services / scheduling daren , thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea . it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing , nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue . if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services immensely . as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture . i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only person that should be involved in the industrials . i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite alright . once again , thanks for listening . ken - attl . htm",ham

"subject: jump in to gain substantial ground immediately we are very excited about this new upcoming stock about to explode montana oil and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to explore further opportunities in alberta canada , is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs . aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news ) announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest . the company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project . symbo | - mogi current price - . 26 reasons to consider mogi : 1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul | market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years . 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets . 4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns . breaking news ! ! april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after . the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban . with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description . project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas , predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics . the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee . through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres ( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 % of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . land discussion our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480 acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160 acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units ( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well . geological discussion pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves . production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system . for more detailed project description please see news release dated ( fri , apr 29 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade tuesday ! go mogi . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .",spam

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .",ham

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ?

"" warning - not the same legal entity "" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect ect , thomas engel / hou / ect ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , faye ellis / hou / ect ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , scott mills / hou / ect ect , richard elwood / hou / ect ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect , gayle horn / corp / enron enron , brant reves / hou / ect ect , russell diamond / hou / ect ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect ect , steve jackson / hou / ect ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .",ham

( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf dear shareholder , addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading . up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market . our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ; with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the various projects they are currently working on . e - direct is another example ; we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus . as of today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) , a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial , accounting and financing for companies in the energy field , from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask ; why the energy related field ? simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching $ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector . according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this year alone , most of which is because of china . the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30 level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone . there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field . these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non - energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own . i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies . we can then continue to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy - related businesses over the next 12 months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records , inc . announces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo fine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development corporation , inc .

"subject: personal contact dear sir / madam , you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker . before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland . the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father . it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice . i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end . you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction . thank for your anticipated co - operations . peter stevens .",spam
