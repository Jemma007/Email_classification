"subject: enron files chapter 11 reorganization to all employees : this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses : - - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner . - - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing . - - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion . - - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline . these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so . as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer . for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination . i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions . when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities . on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future . ken",ham

"subject: important information about united healthcare - please read ! to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc ) concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation . it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 % increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract . while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc , enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well . many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be pre - certified with uhc . these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 . if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed . if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) . open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to consider your elections for 2001 . united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that may impact you or your family .",ham

"subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes . i hope the following will give more clarification . let me know if you have any questions or need more detail ! thanks , dg 3 - 9517 sitara / unify - process * scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify . * impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues . * process - counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b . ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline . the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify . ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change ) ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? ) i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when these type of changes are needed . will keep you posted . thanks , dg from : thomas engel 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 44 am to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect , peggy hedstrom / cal / ect ect , dianne seib / cal / ect ect cc : sylvia a campos / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , faye ellis / hou / ect ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect ect , scott mills / hou / ect ect , russ severson / hou / ect ect , martha stevens / hou / ect ect , karie hastings / hou / ect ect , regina perkins / hou / ect ect , imelda frayre / hou / ect ect , william e kasemervisz / hou / ect ect , hunaid engineer / hou / ect ect , steven gullion / hou / ect ect , larrissa sharma / hou / ect ect , donna greif / hou / ect ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution : if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message : "" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change . "" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . "" warning - not the same legal entity "" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect ect , thomas engel / hou / ect ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , faye ellis / hou / ect ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , scott mills / hou / ect ect , richard elwood / hou / ect ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect ect , dana daigle / corp / enron enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect ect , julie meyers / hou / ect ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect ect , gayle horn / corp / enron enron , brant reves / hou / ect ect , russell diamond / hou / ect ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect ect , steve jackson / hou / ect ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .",ham

quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v . between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems : summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 % enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted . enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production . to do ' s : accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks . pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs . networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been requested . location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv . currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done . data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need . we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know who else will need access . interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface . there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete . scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition . accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started . hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer . please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy",ham

"" ( emphasis added . ) further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles [ 65 , 236 ] for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case , where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted . affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos . er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 ) turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months . without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we therefore uphold the judge on this point . we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be made as frequently . related to pmas reg - preamble , fercsr ? 36 , 710 , procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr 903 , 45 fr 86976 [ 36 , 741 ] historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules . many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations , loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 . these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa - type standards where applicable . many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts . the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra 6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate design . related to purpa fed - law , fercsr ? 5021 , purpa , sec . 111 . consideration and determination respecting certain ratemaking standards . ( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . fed - reg - notice , fercsr ? 37 , 503 , doe responsibilities under title i of purpa ( 4 ) seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season ; prop - reg - preamble , fercsr 1988 - 1998 ? 32 , 457 , administrative determination of full avoided costs , sales of power to qualifying facilities , and inter - connection facilities , march 16 , 1988 , docket no . rm 88 - 6 - 000 , 53 fr 9331 , 55 fr 31882 pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while [ 32 , 174 ] the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors . to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts , especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts . reg - preamble , fercsr 1977 - 1981 ? 30 , 128 , small power production and cogeneration facilities ; regulations implementing section 210 of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 , order no . 69 , february 25 , 1980 , docket no . rm 79 - 55 , 18 cfr 292 , 45 fr 12214 , 45 fr . . . rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .",ham

"subject: alternative work schedule status as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future . i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we know are needed in our work hours . here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting : schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss at the next meeting . each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with hr on schedules being used at enron the following is what i heard at the first meeting : our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels . cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "" just do it "" attitude . there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk changes . late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job . there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule . feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m looking forward to our next meeting - bob",ham

"subject: new tax law update whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes . many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years . but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include : lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 . and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new 10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an opportunity to invest more toward your various goals . education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will improve education savings tools such as : ? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to $ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education expenses . ? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 , distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to their generous contribution limits . ? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher education expenses . ? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses , this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college . previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600 in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and thereafter . higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include : ? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 . after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments . ? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older . and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that apply to you and help you make the most of them . as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be flexible enough to react to year - by - year changes . such planning is where american express financial advisors excels . i ' m backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation , investments , estate and retirement planning , and more to help you make the most of your finances . let me know if you have any questions . i look forward to seeing you . byron "" make all you can , save all you can , give all you can .

"subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18 vance : per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal , depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not . producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level . once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets . non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result in a financial loss ) . in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon as i ascertain that date . in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish this . thank you again for all of your hard work in this area , mary",ham

"subject: proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates ngi ' s daily gas price index breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate . previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates . the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to . commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . "" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . "" she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . "" i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . "" wood said he understood "" the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . "" staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . "" if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , "" one staffer responded . wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , "" but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

( there was actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to "" bounce "" the server twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance . the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the behavior is a "" feature "" or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types of changes at night during scheduled outages . i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again . if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a call . dave n .",ham

"subject: re : big cowboy for august mary : is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where 985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume , and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350 mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of "" nothing "" being confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000 this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is calculating the volumes incorrectly . this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss . tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were originally set up in pops . i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you . thanks , fred tom acton enron 09 / 28 / 2000 08 : 10 am to : fred boas / hou / ect ect cc : subject : big cowboy for august - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by tom acton / corp / enron on 09 / 28 / 2000 08 : 09 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary poorman 09 / 27 / 2000 03 : 56 pm to : daren j farmer / hou / ect ect , tom acton / corp / enron enron cc : clem cernosek / hou / ect ect , howard b camp / hou / ect ect subject : big cowboy for august daren & tom , beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with zero noms flowed a considerable volume . they are as follows : rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx . big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx . total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and our economics . thank you , mary",ham

"subject: organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives : first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe . this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position . second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron wind , will report to cliff . corporate staff we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources , government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . committee structure in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be drawing on this group to lead company - wide initiatives such as the performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses . the executive committee membership is shown on the attached list . we are also forming a new committee  ) the enron corporate policy committee . this group will be responsible for overall corporate policy , personnel management policy and corporate strategy . the enron corporate policy committee membership is also shown on the attached list . we are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital to our highest return opportunities . please join us in congratulating and supporting all of these individuals in their new roles .",ham

( and his bong ) 4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality . 5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance . 6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "" invent the internet "" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of potentially incriminating e - mail ! 7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were the models for the book and movie , "" love story "" even though the book ' s author , erich segal , says not . 8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million dollars in occidental petroleum stock . 9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton "" one of the greatest presidents of our history .

( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria ) who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children , hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband . i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . having noted the confidence reposed on your person , i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general ( my husband ) . this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons . it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf . on your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact , the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband . in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars . in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur ( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 hotvoice . com and phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal . i look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co - operation . in view of all above details , i request you to keep this letter and co - operation highly confidential . best wishes , mrs . mariam abacha .",spam

"subject: enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 26 , 2001 enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub . enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' ' enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december . the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy . it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure . enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications . third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d . "" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

"subject: re : hungry mhetor cheating on spouse i ' ve heard a lot about youlaagan i must have women - - there is nothing unbends the mind like them . all fair in love and war . much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared . life is not a problem to be solved , but a reality to be experienced . our thoughts take the wildest flight : even at the moment when they should arrange themselves in thoughtful order . kids use to ask where they came from , now they tell you where to go i don ' t want to do business with those who don ' t make a profit , because they can ' t give the best service . the liberals can understand everything but people who don ' t understand them . a lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants . beware of no man more than of yourself we carry our worst enemies within us . death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep . rest not . life is sweeping by go and dare before you die . something mighty and sublime , leave behind to conquer time . listen ! encourage . say something . do something . be yourself . lovea man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them a fortune . getting divorced just because you don ' t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do . force without forecast is to little avail . the problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways : by extinction or duplication . our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us .",spam

"subject: this week ' s woodworking tip . . . follow - up good afternoon ! no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them along . kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing : he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding the problem . before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on . another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip ! a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to hear that so many people are enjoying the tips . talk to you again in a few weeks . jon garbison on - line editor woodsmith visit our other woodworking and home improvement sites : 100 + woodworking plans : woodsmith magazine : shopnotes magazine : workbench magazine : kits , jigs , tools , project plans : back issues : woodworking forums : to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at to unsubscribe , send empty email message to : note : your subscribed email address is",ham

"" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .",spam

"" jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the "" expatriate lifestyle "" he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and lyrics of mr . james w . buffett . so it is , that we created our new web site , "" the expatriate zone "" , along with this newsletter of that same name . in december , "" the expatriate zone "" opened its doors with its "" island trading post "" with its holiday shopping service at the "" island trading post . "" over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were awarded for the first two weeks . the "" island trading post "" will open again soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the "" t - shirt of the month .

"" both of which will be closely associated with "" the expatriate zone "" and "" parrotkey . com . "" jackson & bob - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "" expatriate of the month "" james "" sunny jim "" white when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named "" sunny jim "" who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to happen , it usually does . on the first leg of my "" road dawg "" tour ( click on "" road dawg "" ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was "" sunny jim . "" i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it immediately . the cd was his second , called "" life in the laid back lane . "" little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady "" shady floyd "" several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real tour of the us since he moved "" down island "" almost twelve years ago . we got several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article about this "" expatriate "" soon on "" the expatriate zone "" web site . be sure to watch for it . in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great musician . when i asked him about his "" expatriate "" status , his reply was , "" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country , for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience , from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving , hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying palms . "" even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? "" maybe somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within sailing distance of one another , "" was the advice he gave . until we can learn more of "" sunny jim ' s "" world , stop by his web site at and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his latest release "" sandbar serenade , "" for goodness sake , pick one up . you can also read a great interview alex conducted with james at - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - travel into "" the zone "" "" some are running from the irs "" we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops , cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if we feel the need . but get real and throw that "" pager "" away as soon as you can . we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from those of you already living your lives in "" the zone , "" helping the rest of us prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that are preparing to "" disappear "" to places like costa rica , where the "" the expatriate zone "" will become an important tool . how would you like to check out a place to "" disappear "" to and write it off your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into "" the zone "" to places like the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ? well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations . depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up to half the trip . the oceanic society earthwatch institute reef , the reef environmental education foundation after that , all that ' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember , "" no plane on sunday . "" - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "" jimmydotcom "" after many delays , "" jimmydotcom "" has finally gone to the printer with a due date of the middle of april . i hit some "" bumps in the road "" on my way to publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was all worth it . this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on parrot heads . for more information , visit . we have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and samples of the pages on the site . financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you reserve your copy by putting your name on the "" reservation list . "" you will be under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing . let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important . maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends "" that just don ' t get it . "" here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder & president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with this club on the "" road dawg "" tour , and shared an advance copy with his club : "" when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away . we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak !

"" club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third in the "" margaritaville cafe - late nite "" series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was recorded . you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t heard ct ' s version of "" african friend "" you ' re in for a real treat . along with that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer , "" cario "" and bob marley ' s "" no woman , no cry . "" at the new web site , fans can "" now "" order their favorite club trini cds using their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available . i think a true "" expatriate musical library "" is incomplete without club trini . this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer , came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the "" ice cream vendor "" shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok , pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jesters and friends note card series tro - pics has just released their first note cards series from their "" jesters and friends "" original oils . friends , places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isn ' t personal enough . the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and visit them . included in the "" jesters "" series are our good friends tim glancey and wally nickel . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - millennium change bubba style i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this "" new millennium "" thing , one bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at the last minute , i had a change of heart . and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded together for me , making the millennium change over very special . if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our new "" the expatriate zone "" web site at and go to the web version of this newsletter . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - flash ! ! !

"subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200 mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance . this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .",ham
